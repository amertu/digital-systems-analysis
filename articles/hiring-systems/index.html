  <h1>Broken Hiring Systems</h1>
  <h1 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
  <p>test The persistent dysfunction in how tech hiring
  operates—particularly in Europe—reflects deeper structural issues
  beyond surface-level inefficiencies. While some attribute the decline
  in software engineering demand to automation and AI, this perspective
  overlooks a more fundamental problem: the flawed conceptual
  foundations of modern hiring systems.</p>
  <h1 class="unnumbered" id="hiring-as-a-mechanical-process">Hiring as a
  Mechanical Process</h1>
  <p>Many companies treat hiring not as a strategic, core function but
  as a process to be modularized, outsourced, or automated. Decisions
  are often made without sufficient involvement from engineering
  leadership, which is brought in too late, if at all. Hiring processes
  are driven by funnel metrics like time-to-hire, pipeline conversion,
  and cost-per-hire, which prioritize throughput over thoughtful team
  building and long-term value creation <span class="citation"

  <h1 class="unnumbered"
  id="mechanistic-roots-and-taylorist-logic">Mechanistic Roots and
  Taylorist Logic</h1>
  <p>This fixation on efficiency and abstraction is not new. It reflects
  an outdated logic rooted in industrial-era principles of scientific
  management—what has been referred to as “digital Taylorism” <span
  class="citation" data-cites="mitev2021digitaltaylorism">(Mitev and
  Venters 2021)</span>. These models, originally designed for repetitive
  factory work, have been adapted—often uncritically—to knowledge work
  contexts like software engineering. As a result, hiring systems
  prioritize standardization, predictability, and risk-aversion, even in
  roles that demand adaptability and creativity <span class="citation"

  2019)</span>.</p>
  <h1 class="unnumbered" id="the-platformization-of-hiring">The
  Platformization of Hiring</h1>
  <p>Hiring in tech has increasingly been absorbed into platform-based
  systems that reduce complex candidate profiles into keyword filters
  and ranking scores. This shift furthers the detachment of labor from
  context, as companies rely on algorithmic systems that obscure value
  and introduce bias <span class="citation"
  data-cites="gray2019ghostwork jones2021work graeber2018bullshit">(Gray
  and Suri 2019; Jones 2021; Graeber 2018)</span>. Referrals and
  internal networks become key gatekeepers, bypassing formal structures
  altogether—a process confirmed by LinkedIn’s own economic reports
  <span class="citation" data-cites="linkedin2020trends">(Graph
  2020)</span>.</p>
  <h1 class="unnumbered" id="a-system-that-cannot-learn">A System That
  Cannot Learn</h1>
  <p>The result is a hiring ecosystem that does not merely make poor
  choices—it fails to learn from them. Because it was not designed for
  reflective adaptation but for cost-efficient filtering, meaningful
  feedback loops are absent. The dominance of KPIs creates what Muller
  calls a “tyranny of metrics,” where data replaces judgment and
  visibility overrides understanding <span class="citation"
  data-cites="muller2018tyranny">(Muller 2018)</span>.</p>
  <h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Modern tech hiring systems are not broken because of automation or
  a lack of qualified talent. They are failing by design—guided by
  legacy assumptions that reduce people to inputs, obscure strategic
  thinking, and prioritize process over purpose. Until hiring is
  reclaimed as a core human and organizational function, the system will
  continue to filter out not just bad fits, but often the best ones.</p>
