<h1 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>test The persistent dysfunction in how tech hiring
operates—particularly in Europe—reflects deeper structural issues beyond
surface-level inefficiencies. While some attribute the decline in
software engineering demand to automation and AI, this perspective
overlooks a more fundamental problem: the flawed conceptual foundations
of modern hiring systems.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="hiring-as-a-mechanical-process">Hiring as a
Mechanical Process</h1>
<p>Many companies treat hiring not as a strategic, core function but as
a process to be modularized, outsourced, or automated. Decisions are
often made without sufficient involvement from engineering leadership,
which is brought in too late, if at all. Hiring processes are driven by
funnel metrics like time-to-hire, pipeline conversion, and
cost-per-hire, which prioritize throughput over thoughtful team building
and long-term value creation <span class="citation"

<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="mechanistic-roots-and-taylorist-logic">Mechanistic Roots and
Taylorist Logic</h1>
<p>This fixation on efficiency and abstraction is not new. It reflects
an outdated logic rooted in industrial-era principles of scientific
management—what has been referred to as “digital Taylorism” <span
class="citation" data-cites="mitev2021digitaltaylorism"></span>. These
models, originally designed for repetitive factory work, have been
adapted—often uncritically—to knowledge work contexts like software
engineering. As a result, hiring systems prioritize standardization,
predictability, and risk-aversion, even in roles that demand
adaptability and creativity <span class="citation"
data-cites="buchanan2019organizational"></span>.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="the-platformization-of-hiring">The
Platformization of Hiring</h1>
<p>Hiring in tech has increasingly been absorbed into platform-based
systems that reduce complex candidate profiles into keyword filters and
ranking scores. This shift furthers the detachment of labor from
context, as companies rely on algorithmic systems that obscure value and
introduce bias <span class="citation"
data-cites="gray2019ghostwork jones2021work graeber2018bullshit"></span>.
Referrals and internal networks become key gatekeepers, bypassing formal
structures altogether—a process confirmed by LinkedIn’s own economic
reports <span class="citation"
data-cites="linkedin2020trends"></span>.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="a-system-that-cannot-learn">A System That
Cannot Learn</h1>
<p>The result is a hiring ecosystem that does not merely make poor
choices—it fails to learn from them. Because it was not designed for
reflective adaptation but for cost-efficient filtering, meaningful
feedback loops are absent. The dominance of KPIs creates what Muller
calls a “tyranny of metrics,” where data replaces judgment and
visibility overrides understanding <span class="citation"
data-cites="muller2018tyranny"></span>.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Modern tech hiring systems are not broken because of automation or a
lack of qualified talent. They are failing by design—guided by legacy
assumptions that reduce people to inputs, obscure strategic thinking,
and prioritize process over purpose. Until hiring is reclaimed as a core
human and organizational function, the system will continue to filter
out not just bad fits, but often the best ones.</p>
